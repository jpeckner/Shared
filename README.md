# jpeckner/Shared

Shared is an iOS framework containing Swift code for networking, location services, UI, and more.

### Prerequisites

To build the Shared target itself without running tests, make sure you've first installed [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery#installation).

Building and running the tests also requires [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start). Run `carthage bootstrap` from the root directory to build the necessary dependencies.

## Built With

* [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) - Swift matcher framework
* [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) - Swift BDD testing framework
* [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) - Used to generate boilerplate source and mocks code
